# Config file for ChIP-seq pipeline

# The name of the sequencing run
# run: "SRR931713"
run: "SRR931714"

# The type of sequencing run:
#    "miseq" - around 30 million reads
#    "hiseq" - around 300 million reads
#    "pooled" - around 1 billion reads (merged replicates)
#    "novaseq" â€“ around 300 - 500 million reads
run_type: "miseq"

# The factor for which the IP was performed
# E.g., Ser2-Abcam
ip_factor: "NIPBL"

# Cell type
# E.g., HCT116-RAD21-AID-6h (<Cell line>-<Factor for depletion>-<Method of depletion>-<Treatment time>)
cell_type: "dp_thymocytes"

# The parent directory containing the input FASTQ files
#   Note 1: difference with pbs set-up is that this is simply the path to the fastq folder
#   not the path to run folder (i.e., need to concatenate `run` variable with `data_dir` variable 
#   e.g., `data_dir + run`)
#   Note 2: the pbs set-up used Bash logic to recognize fastq files 
#   but, this set-up assumes that the config file is static (yaml not Bash)
#   The functionality for both note 1 and 2 is done in the Snakefile itself via rules
data_dir: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/processing/results"

# The name of the primary genome
# For example: "hg19", "hg38", "dm3", "mm9", "mm10"
genome: "mm9"

# The reference genome FASTA file for aligning the reads
# (The same directory must also contain the BWA index files)
fasta: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/processing/genomes/mm9/mm9.fa"

# The chrom.sizes file from UCSC Genome browser
# for the relevant genome build
chrom_sizes: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/processing/genomes/mm9/mm9.chrom.sizes"

# The BAM file for the ChIP-seq input control
# (Required for spp; not required for macs2)
# If not available, set to "none"
# input_control: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/processing/input_controls/hg38/HCT116_input_hg38_CHH0020.bam"
input_control: "none"

# The peak-calling algorithm ("macs2" or "spp")
# * "spp" requires input control
# * "macs2" may call peaks with or without input control
# If input control is given, then should be set to "spp". "macs2" otherwise
# peak_caller: "spp"
peak_caller: "macs2"

# ENCODE blacklist
# (If not available, set to "none")
# blacklist: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/ch-lee-lab_processing/genomes/hg38/hg38_blacklist.bed"
blacklist: "none"

#### Advanced options ####

# The directory containing the executables for Minji lab
bin_dir: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/packages"

# The directory to contain the output folder (output folder is the "run" variable above)
out_dir_folder: "/nfs/turbo/umms-minjilab/processing/results"
# out_dir_folder: "" # debug

#### Advanced parameters ####

min_mapq: 30 # samtools_filtering (default is 30)

z_thresh: 6 # peak_caller spp (default is 6)

bwa_threads: 10 # map_reads (default is 20)
